# Third-party notices

Adari's desktop app includes code and files from the projects below.
This file ships in every package (at the root of the app's `app.asar`) and
holds each project's notice and full licence text, so it is complete on its
own.

## Code adapted from T3 Code

T3 Code, https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code (read at e6e2ab05, 2026-11-01; the
update rows read again at 09a54f01, 2026-11-08). These files of ours contain code
adapted from it; the source paths are in the T3 Code repository.

| Our file | Adapted from (T3 Code) | What |
|---|---|---|
| `src/main/protocol.ts` | `apps/desktop/src/electron/ElectronProtocol.ts` | the privileged app scheme, the asset handler and its path checks, the CSP header on every response |
| `src/main/window.ts` | `apps/desktop/src/window/DesktopWindow.ts` | title bar options per OS (hiddenInset and traffic lights from the top bar height on macOS, title bar overlay elsewhere), webPreferences, the window-open and navigation guards |
| `src/main/menu.ts` | `apps/desktop/src/window/DesktopApplicationMenu.ts` | the application menu's shape (App menu with Check for Updates…, Edit, View, Window) |
| `electron-builder.config.cjs` | `scripts/build-desktop-artifact.ts` (`createBuildConfig`) | the artifact name pattern, one Electron language, the mac dmg + zip pair and the dmg window layout, the Linux AppImage + deb pair, the static AppImage runtime pin, the deb dependency list, NSIS with npmRebuild off, `publish` set explicitly |
| `src/main/updates.ts` | `apps/desktop/src/updates/DesktopUpdates.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/electron/ElectronUpdater.ts` | the updater's settings (autoDownload and autoInstallOnAppQuit off, prerelease off, the feed set explicitly, a generic feed for a test server), the first check 15 seconds after start and then every 4 minutes, and the check, download and install-on-restart flow, without T3's channels and Effect wiring |
| `src/shared/updates.ts` | `apps/desktop/src/updates/updateMachine.ts`, `apps/web/src/components/desktopUpdate.logic.ts`, `apps/web/src/components/desktopUpdate.toast.tsx` | the update states and their steps, the button's action and tooltip per state, the install question and the downloaded toast's words |
| `src/renderer/components/UpdatePill.tsx` | `apps/web/src/components/sidebar/SidebarUpdatePill.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/sidebar/DesktopUpdateStatusIcon.tsx` | the update button in the sidebar's foot: download arrow, progress ring drawn with a dash offset, restart arrow |

## Terminal engine: ghostty-web and Ghostty

`ghostty-web` 0.4.0 (https://github.com/coder/ghostty-web) is bundled into the
renderer by the build, unmodified: its canvas renderer and input handling, and
`ghostty-vt.wasm`, Ghostty's terminal core (https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty)
compiled to WebAssembly. ghostty-web is a build-time (dev) dependency, so its npm
package is not in our packages; its own `LICENSE` holds only Coder's MIT text, not
Ghostty's. Both licence texts follow.

## React

`react` 19.3.0, `react-dom` 19.3.0 and `scheduler` 0.28.0
(https://github.com/facebook/react) are bundled into the renderer by the build
(build-time dependencies, not in our packages as npm packages). The three
packages carry the same licence text:

## Fonts

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

## npm packages in the package

The main process loads `ssh2` 1.17.0 and `electron-updater` 6.8.9, and the
packages they depend on, from the package's own `node_modules`; each keeps its
licence file there. Electron's licences come with Electron in the app.

| Package | Version | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| `argparse` | 2.0.1 | Python-2.0 |
| `asn1` | 0.2.6 | MIT |
| `bcrypt-pbkdf` | 1.0.2 | BSD-3-Clause |
| `builder-util-runtime` | 9.7.0 | MIT |
| `debug` | 4.4.3 | MIT |
| `electron-updater` | 6.8.9 | MIT |
| `fs-extra` | 10.1.0 | MIT |
| `graceful-fs` | 4.2.11 | ISC |
| `js-yaml` | 4.3.2 | MIT |
| `jsonfile` | 6.2.1 | MIT |
| `lazy-val` | 1.0.5 | MIT |
| `lodash.escaperegexp` | 4.1.2 | MIT |
| `lodash.isequal` | 4.5.0 | MIT |
| `ms` | 2.1.3 | MIT |
| `safer-buffer` | 2.1.2 | MIT |
| `sax` | 1.6.1 | BlueOak-1.0.0 |
| `semver` (inside `electron-updater`) | 7.7.4 | ISC |
| `ssh2` | 1.17.0 | MIT (its package.json; the lockfile has no licence field) |
| `tiny-typed-emitter` | 2.1.0 | MIT |
| `tweetnacl` | 0.14.5 | Unlicense |
| `universalify` | 2.0.1 | MIT |

These 21 are the production dependencies in `package-lock.json` (entries not marked
`dev` or `devOptional`), less `cpu-features`, `buildcheck` and `nan`: ssh2's optional
native parts, which `electron-builder.config.cjs` keeps out of the package.
